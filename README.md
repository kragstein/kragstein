Welcome to my git repos. Where I put some of the code I work on.

You'll find 3 javascript games I play daily.

## Lingo

Lingo is a re-implementation (or refactoring) of Wordle.

I wanted to understand how the UI was implemented.

The CSS is identical, but most of the javascript was
re-written and commented.

## Numero

Numero is a mental arithmetic game - with additions substraction,
multiplication and divisions, up to 10,000.

Each level is beaten when a row of 10 correct answers is reached.

Every error sets the current streak back to 0.

It goes up to level 16 and gets pretty challenging. 

There's also different settings to play with different scripts,
to make it extra challenging.

## Lernkartei

A flash cards game to learn german vocabulary. 

It uses the 1500 most frequently used german words as dataset.
